Things you'll need
==================

* an Atmel AT90USB based controller board
* avr-gcc 4
* humble hacker firmware source code
* kspec code generator

Controller board
----------------

You can use Atmel's [AT90USBKey][usbkey] demo board, but a better choice may be PJRC's [Teensy++][teensy].

[usbkey]:http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3879
[teensy]:http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/

Alternately, you can design and build your own AT90USB-based controller board.  Any of AT901286/7 or AT90646/7 MCUs will work.


AVR-GCC
-------

There are avr-gcc packages for the big three platforms.  Installation instructions can be found on each site.

- Windows: [WinAVR][winavr]
- Mac OSX: [AVR CrossPack][crosspack]
- Linux:   depends on the distribution.  For example, on Ubuntu execute: `sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc`

humble hacker source code
-------------------------

Although there are [tarballs and zipfiles][hh_downloads] available, it's best to just install and use [git].  That way you can easily update the source when bugs are fixed and features added.  [GitHub] has good [git installation instructions][git_install] for each platform.

The source code can be found [here][hh_source].  To get it, from the command-line, execute:

    git clone git://github.com/humblehacker/firmware.git
        
This will place the source code in a directory called `firmware` in your current directory.

kspec code generator
--------------------

There are pre-built versions for each of the major platforms.  Go to the [downloads] page on github and grab the latest version for your platform.  Once you've downloaded it, extract the archive and place the resulting binary in the `firmware` repository directory.
